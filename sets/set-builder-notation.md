# Set-Builder Notation

The following denotes the set formed by the values of $x$ for which $P(x)$ is _true_:

$$
\\{\ x\ |\ P(x)\ \\}
$$

- for example:

$$
\\{\ x\ |\ x \in [1,4]\ \\} =
\\{1,2,3,4\\}
$$

- `:` can be used instead of `|`:

$$
\\{\ x:\ x \in [1,4]\ \\} =
\\{1,2,3,4\\}
$$

## Predicate

- predicate in expression:

$$
\\{
x^2\ |\ x \in [1,4]
\\}
$$

- predicate out of expression:

$$
\\{
x^2\ |\ P(x)
\\}
$$

$$
P(x) = x \in [1,4]
$$

> both of the above yields $\\{ 1,4,9,16 \\}$
