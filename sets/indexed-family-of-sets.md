# Indexed Family of Sets

- **family of sets** is a set that consists of sets, for example:

$$
{\cal F} = \\{ \\{1,2\\}, \\{2,4\\}\\}
$$

- **indexed family of sets** is a set of sets referenced by some index (being a term of **indexing set**), for example, if _indexing set_ $I = \\{ 1,2 \\}$:

$$
{\cal F} = \\{ A_i \\}_{i \in I} =
\\{ A_i\ |\ i \in I \\} = \\{ A_1, A_2 \\}
$$

## Examples

- if indexing set $I = \\{ 1,2 \\}$
- _i-th_ set of ${\cal F}$ is defined with _set-builder notation_ as $A_i = \\{ i, 2i \\}$

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
{\cal F} & = \\{ A_i \\}_{i \in I}
\\
& = \\{ A_1, A_2 \\}
\\
& = \\{ \\{ 1,2 \\}, \\{ 2,4 \\} \\}
\\
\\
\because & A_1 = \\{ 1,2 \\}
\\
& A_2 = \\{ 2,4 \\}
\end{array}
$$

----

- if indexing set $T = \\{ 1,2,3,4 \\}$
- _t-th_ set of ${\cal F}$ is defined as $A_t = \\{ m \in {\mathbb N}: t \lt m \\}$
- ${\cal F}$ is thereby as follows:

$$
{\cal F} = \\{A_t\\}_{t \in T} = \\{ m \in {\mathbb N}: t \lt m \\}
$$

- terms of ${\cal F}$ are as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
A_1 = \\{ 2,3,4,5,\dots \\}
\\
A_2 = \\{ 3,4,5,6,\dots \\}
\\
A_3 = \\{ 4,5,6,7,\dots \\}
\\
A_4 = \\{ 5,6,7,8,\dots \\}
\end{array}
$$
