# Tangent Line of a Function

A tangent line to a function at given point is a line that is in contact with the graph of the function only in that particular point.

A slope of this line is the same as the function's slope at that point.

Equation for a tangent line of a function $f(x)$ at point $(x_0,0)$ is as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
y = mx + i
\\
\ 
\\
m = f'(x_0)
\\
i = f(x_0) - x_0 \cdot f'(x_0)
\end{array}
$$

> or just:  
> $y = (x-x_0)f'(x_0)+f(x_0)$

Coordinates of the tangent point $P$ are as follows:

$$
\begin{cases}
P_x = x_0
\\
P_y = mx_0 + i
\end{cases}
$$
