# Derivatives Rules

## Power Rule

$$
\large
[x^n]' = nx^{n-1}
$$

## Constant Rule

$$
\large
C' = 0
$$

## Constant Multiple Rule

$$
\large
[C\ f(x)]' = C\ f'(x)
$$

## Sum/Difference Rule

$$
\large
[f(x) \pm g(x)]' = f'(x) \pm g'(x)
$$

## Chain Rule

$$
\large
[f(g(x))]' = f'(g(x))g'(x)
$$

## Product Rule

$$
\large
[f(x)g(x)]' = f(x)g'(x) + g(x)f'(x)
$$

## Quotient Rule

$$
\large
\left[\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right]' = \frac{g(x)f'(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}
$$
