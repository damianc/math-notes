# Line Intersection

> formulas for $A$, $B$ and $C$ are below this section

$$
\Delta = B^2-4AC
$$

- if $\Delta \lt 0$: there is not intersection
- if $\Delta = 0$: there is 1 intersection point $x_0=\frac{-B}{2A}$
- if $\Delta \gt 0$: there are 2 intersection points $x_{1,2} = \frac{-B\pm\sqrt{\Delta}}{2A}$

## Intersection with Parabola

$$
\begin{array}{l}
A = a
\\
B = b-m
\\
C = c-i
\end{array}
$$

## Intersection with Hyperbola

$$
\begin{array}{l}
A = mc
\\
B = ic+md-a
\\
C = id-b
\end{array}
$$

## Intersection with Circle

$$
\begin{array}{l}
A = 1+m^2
\\
B = 2((i-b)m-a)
\\
C = a^2 + (b-i)^2 - r^2
\end{array}
$$

- for a circle with center at $(0,0)$:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
A = 1+m^2
\\
B = 2im
\\
C = i^2-r^2
\end{array}
$$

## Intersection with Ellipse

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\varphi = \left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^2
\\
A = m^2 + \varphi
\\
B = 2((i-k)m-\varphi h)
\\
C = (i-k)^2-b^2+\varphi h^2
\end{array}
$$

- for an ellipse with center at $(0,0)$:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\varphi = \left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^2
\\
A = m^2+\varphi
\\
B = 2im
\\
C = i^2-b^2
\end{array}
$$
