# Finding a Line

## By Two Points

Line that passes through points $A=(x_1,y_1)$ and $B=(x_2,y_2)$:

$$
f(x) = ax+b
$$

where:

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
a & = & \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}
\\
\ 
\\
b & = & \frac{x_2y_1-x_1y_2}{x_2-x_1}
\\
& \equiv & y_1-ax_1
\\
& \equiv & y_2-ax_2
\end{array}
$$

> in short:  
> $\frac{(x-x_1)(y_2-y_1)}{x_2-x_1}+y_1$

## By Parallel Line

Line that is parallel to $mx+i$ and passes through point $P=(x_0,y_0)$:

$$
f(x) = ax+b
$$

where:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
a = m
\\
b = y_0-ax_0
\end{array}
$$

> in short:  
> $(x-x_0)m+y_0$

## By Perpendicular Line

Line that is perpendicular to $mx+i$ and passes through point $P=(x_0,y_0)$:

$$
f(x) = ax+b
$$

where:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
a = -\frac{1}{m}
\\
b = y_0-ax_0
\end{array}
$$

> in short:  
> $\frac{x_0-x}{m}+y_0$

## By Angle

Line that intersects x axis at angle $\alpha$ and passes through point $P=(x_0,y_0)$:

$$
f(x) = ax+b
$$

where:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
a = \tan(\alpha)
\\
b = y_0-ax_0
\end{array}
$$

> in short:  
> $(x-x_0)\tan(\alpha)+y_0$
