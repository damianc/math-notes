# Relationships Between Two Circles

![Two circles relationships](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damianc/math-notes/refs/heads/master/_images/anal-geom/circle/two-circles-relationships.jpg)

| Case | Description | Condition |  Common Points |
|--|--|--|--|
| **A** | **separated** (one circle is completely outside the other) | $$d \gt r_1 + r_2$$ | 0 |
| **B** | **included** (one circle is completely inside the other) | $$d \lt \vert r_1-r_2 \vert$$ | 0 |
| **C** | **circumscribed** (circles touch externally) | $$d = r_1 + r_2$$ | 1 |
| **D** | **inscribed** (circles touch internally) | $$d = \vert r_1 - r_2 \vert$$ | 1 |
| **E** | **intersected** (circles intersect at two points) | $$\vert r_1 - r_2 \vert \lt d \lt r_1 + r_2$$ | 2 |
| **F** | **equal** (circles have the same center and radius) | $$d + \vert r_1 - r_2 \vert = 0$$ | $\infty$ |
