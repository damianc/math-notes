# Point Moved Along Line

![Point moved along line](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damianc/math-notes/refs/heads/master/_images/anal-geom/line/point-moved-along-line.png)

For a line $f(x) = mx+i$, coordinates of point $P'$ being the point $P$  moved along the line by distance $d$ are:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
P'_x = P_x + \vec{x}
\\
P'_y = f(P'_x)
\end{array}
$$

where:

$$
\vec{x} = \frac{d}{\sqrt{1+m^2}}
$$
