# Point Moved Along Line

![Point moved along line](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damianc/math-notes/refs/heads/master/_images/anal-geom/line/point-moved-along-line.png)

For a line $f(x) = mx+i$, coordinates of point $P'$ being the point $P$  moved along the line by distance $d$ are:

$$
\large
\begin{array}{l}
P'_x = P_x + \vec{x}
\\
P'_y = f(P'_x)
\end{array}
$$

where:

$$
\vec{x} = \frac{d}{\sqrt{1+m^2}}
$$

## Line Equation by 2 Points

Equation of a line passing through points $A$ and $B$ is as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
y = mx+i
\\
\ 
\\
m = \frac{y_A-y_B}{x_A-x_B}
\\
i = y_A - m \cdot x_A
\end{array}
$$

## Distance as Percent

If $D$ is a distance between points $A$ and $B$, distance $d$ being $n$% of the distance $D$ is:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
d = \frac{D \cdot n}{100} &
\text{for } n \in \langle 0,100 \rangle
\\
d = D \cdot n &
\text{for } n \in \langle 0,1 \rangle
\end{array}
$$
