# Arithmetic Sequence

Arithemic sequence is a sequence in which _n-th_ term is defined as:

$$
a_n = a_{n-1}+\Delta
$$

For example, for a difference factor $\Delta = 2$ and the very first term $a_1=0$, the sequence starts as follows:

$$
0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,...
$$

Arithmetic sequence may be defined in set-builder notation as:

$$
\\{ a_1 + (n-1)\Delta \vert n \geqslant 1 \\}
$$

## Getting _n-th_ Term

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)\Delta
$$

- by _k-th_ term:

$$
a_n = a_k + (n-k)\Delta
$$

## Sum of $n$ First Terms

$$
S_n = \left[ a_1+ \frac{(n-1)\Delta}{2} \right] \cdot n
$$

or as repeated $n$ times arithmetic mean of first and last terms:

$$
S_n = \frac{a_1+a_n}{2} \cdot n
$$
